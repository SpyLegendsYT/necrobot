Negative thoughts will wear away at you to the point where you may give up control of the situation and concede defeat.  ",
	"**The Moon**: You are projecting fear into your present and your future, based on past experiences.

It may be that you believe that what you really want to do with your life is impractical or unrealistic, or your past experiences in life have convinced you that you are stuck with what you have and it is too late to change now. ",
	"**The Sun**: You have an innate sense of confidence right now. Life is good, the sun is shining and you are on your way to achieving your goals. You open the curtains with the sun shining on your face. Having struggled through the shadow sides you now know yourself and know where you are heading, and the sun illuminates your path. ",
	"**The Sun Reversed**: Finding the positive aspects to a particular situation may prove to be difficult. The clouds may be blocking out the warmth, and preventing you from feeling as though everything is on track. You may have experienced setbacks that have damaged your enthusiasm and optimism and have perhaps led you to question whether you can really achieve what you have set out to achieve. ",
	"**Judgment**: You have had a recent epiphany or an ‘awakening’ where you have come to a realisation that you need to live your life in a different way and you need to be true to yourself and your needs. You have opened yourself up to a new possibility – to lead a fulfilling life that serves your higher needs and that offers inspiration and hope to others. ",

This means that permissions must be manually assigned using the `perms` command. The server owner and users with administrator rights are automatically given level 5 and 4 accordingly but users needing permission level 3 and below will need manual assignment. When a user leaves a server their permission level is reset to 0, when a NecroBot Admin joins their level is automatically set to 6. All users with level 4 and above can use this commad but they can only set the permission level of other users to a number below their own."},

Such things are money, badges and exp are discord wide and therefore are harder to obtain. Things like waifus, warnings and permissions are user server-specific data and therefore they can often be modified by a server's authorities. Other-server speccific data are things like the automoderation list, the starboard channel, ect... The thing to keep in mind is that server specific data can be edited by server authorities while discord-wide data can only be edited at the discretion of NecroBot admins."},

It includes a lot of subcommands which each cater to certain part so make sure to check out the help guide. In addition, several other commands allow you to decide how much NecroBot sees and does and how much users can use it. For example, the `disable` command allows to disable specific commands on the entire server, the `automod` command allows you to pick which channel/role/user is tracked by the bot automoderation and the `ignore` command allows you to pick who can and can't use the bot's features.
